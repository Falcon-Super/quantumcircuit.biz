It was a crisp spring day on March 25, 2024, when I decided to take a detour from my usual BSD and Linux haunts. My destination? OmniOS, a distribution of the Illumos operating system. Little did I know I was about to embark on a journey that would challenge my assumptions and expand my Unix horizons.

## The Land of pfexec

The first surprise came when I tried to elevate my privileges. No sudo? No doas? In OmniOS, I discovered, we pfexec. It's like stepping into a parallel universe where everything is familiar, yet slightly off-kilter. I found myself chanting "pfexec, pfexec" like a mantra as I navigated this new landscape.

## Package Management: The Plot Thickens

Just when I thought I had seen every possible variation of package management, OmniOS threw me another curveball. The native package manager felt like a cryptic puzzle, a reminder that in the world of Unix-like systems, variety truly is the spice of life.

## Enter pkgsrc: A Familiar Face in a Strange Land

Feeling a bit lost, I stumbled upon a script that promised to bootstrap NetBSD's pkgsrc. Like a drowning man clutching at a lifeline, I ran that script faster than you can say "package dependency hell." And lo and behold, it worked! Suddenly, I had access to a vast repository of familiar tools. It was like finding a McDonald's in the middle of the Sahara – not quite local cuisine, but comforting nonetheless.

## The Road Not Taken: OpenIndiana

In my quest for Illumos enlightenment, I also attempted to install OpenIndiana. However, for reasons that now escape my caffeine-addled brain, it didn't work out. Was it user error? A hardware incompatibility? Or perhaps OpenIndiana sensed my recent dalliance with OmniOS and decided to play hard to get? The world may never know.

## Reflections on the Illumos Ecosystem

This brief foray into OmniOS has left me intrigued. It's a reminder of the rich history and diversity in the Unix world. From its roots in OpenSolaris to its current place in the Illumos ecosystem, OmniOS represents a different path in Unix evolution.

The experience has piqued my curiosity about Illumos, OpenSolaris, and even Oracle Solaris. What other unique features and design philosophies might these systems hold? How do they approach problems differently from the BSD and Linux worlds I'm more familiar with?

## Looking Ahead

As I return to my familiar hunting grounds of BSD and Linux, I carry with me new questions and perspectives. The Unix landscape is vast and varied, with each distribution and flavor offering its own unique take on computing.

Will I dive deeper into the Illumos world? Only time will tell. But one thing's for certain – in the ever-evolving world of open-source operating systems, there's always something new to discover. And sometimes, the most interesting discoveries come from the roads less traveled.

So here's to OmniOS, to pfexec, to esoteric package managers, and to the joy of perpetual learning in the world of technology. May your packets always find their destination, and may your file systems never fragment.
