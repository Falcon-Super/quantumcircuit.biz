Recently, I took a step toward building my own online presence by purchasing the domain **quantumcircuit.biz** from Namecheap. The cost? A mere $6 for the entire year. Not a bad deal for something that will serve as the digital hub for my tech and business endeavors.

### The Email Setup: Zoho Over ProtonMail

With the domain in hand, my next task was setting up a professional email address: **salman@quantumcircuit.biz**. I originally considered using ProtonMail, but I ended up subscribing to **Zoho** instead. The decision was simple: Zoho was more affordable and, conveniently, their servers are located in **Saudi Arabia**. This proximity felt like a nice bonus.

### The Embarrassing Part: Locked Out of My Namecheap Account

Now, for the not-so-glorious part of this journey. Shortly after buying the domain, I found myself **locked out** of my Namecheap account. Naturally, I contacted customer support, feeling pretty confident that there was some kind of technical issue. After a few back-and-forths, it turned out I had **misspelled my username**.

Yes, you read that right. I—a self-proclaimed techie—had made the classic error of typo-ing my way into oblivion. After a brief moment of embarrassment (and a good laugh), I fixed the issue, and everything was back on track.

### Moving Forward

Now that quantumcircuit.biz is officially mine, and with email set up, I’m ready to focus on building the actual website and sharing my journey with the world. Stay tuned for updates!
