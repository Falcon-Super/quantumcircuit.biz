Welcome to Bits, Business & Beyond, a journey through the intertwining worlds of technology, business, and economics. 

I'm a curious explorer navigating the vast landscape of operating systems, from the familiar terrains of Linux to the more exotic realms of BSD and beyond. My adventures have taken me from the user-friendly shores of Ubuntu to the security-focused fortress of OpenBSD, with plenty of distro-hopping in between.

By day, I'm a data scientist and developer, wrestling with Rust, Docker, and Apache Arrow to wrangle complex datasets into submission. By night (and sometimes into the wee hours of the morning), I'm a self-proclaimed sysadmin, turning innocent home servers into routers and engaging in epic battles with firewalls.

This blog is a chronicle of my technical misadventures, hard-won insights, and occasional victories. Here, you'll find:

- Deep dives into operating systems, from mainstream Linux distros to the niche worlds of BSD and Plan 9
- Tales from the data science trenches, exploring tools like Rust and Apache Arrow
- Sysadmin war stories, featuring config file cacophonies and firewall frustrations
- Reflections on the intersections of technology, business, and economics

Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, a curious beginner, or just someone who enjoys a good story of triumph (or failure) in the face of technological adversity, you'll find something here to inform, entertain, or possibly horrify you.

Join me as we explore the bits, wrestle with the bytes, and ponder how it all fits into the bigger picture of business and beyond. Just remember: when all else fails, there's always coffee. Lots and lots of coffee.
