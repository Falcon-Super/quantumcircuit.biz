Welcome to Quantum Circuit, where we dive deep into the weird and wonderful world of technology, one sleep-deprived adventure at a time.

I'm your host, a curious tech enthusiast with a penchant for turning simple tasks into Herculean challenges. By day, I'm a data scientist and developer, wrangling unruly datasets with Rust, Docker, and Apache Arrow. By night (and often into the wee hours of the morning), I transform into a self-proclaimed sysadmin, turning innocent home servers into routers and engaging in cage matches with firewalls.

This blog is a chronicle of my technical misadventures, hard-won insights, and occasional victories. Here, you'll find:

- Deep dives into operating systems, from mainstream Linux distros to the niche worlds of BSD and beyond. Ever wondered what happens when you give OpenBSD a root partition smaller than a TikTok video? Stick around, and you'll find out!

- Tales from the data science trenches, exploring tools like Rust and Apache Arrow. Watch as I turn complex datasets into... slightly less complex datasets.

- Sysadmin war stories, featuring config file cacophonies and firewall frustrations. Learn from my mistakes, like the time I played DNS roulette with `/etc/resolv.conf`. Spoiler: nobody wins at DNS roulette.

- Reflections on the intersections of technology, business, and economics. Because sometimes, you need to step back and ask, "Why am I doing this to myself?"

Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, a curious beginner, or just someone who enjoys watching others descend into madness via command line, you'll find something here to inform, entertain, or possibly horrify you.

Join me as we explore the bits, wrestle with the bytes, and ponder the great questions of our time, like "Why did I think turning off X11 at 3 AM was a good idea?" and "Is coffee a food group?"

Remember: In the world of tech, the only constant is change. Well, that and the fact that your perfectly working config will break the moment you try to show it to someone else.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with a man page and a very large cup of coffee.

Happy hacking, and may your uptime be ever in your favor!
