Recently, I decided to dive into the retro gaming world with **PICO-8**, a fantasy console for making, sharing, and playing tiny games. I picked it up for **$15**, and although there’s no official BSD version (unfortunately), there are versions for **Linux**, **Raspberry Pi**, **Windows**, and **macOS**—which works just fine for me since I’m running macOS.

### Exploring the Quirky Games of PICO-8

One of the first games that caught my eye was **Harold's Really Bad Day**. It’s not your typical platformer, as it introduces a strange but brilliant revival mechanic where you use your old lives as bridges to progress through the level. It’s both frustrating and genius at the same time, perfectly encapsulating the charm of PICO-8 games.

What surprised me the most was discovering that PICO-8 games are actually **special PNG files**. When you download or create a game, you’re essentially working with an image file that encodes all the game’s data. It’s mind-blowing to see how much creativity and content developers can pack into such a tiny space.

### Lua Scripting: A Familiar Friend

One of the things that made jumping into PICO-8 a bit easier for me is that the scripting language used for developing games is **Lua**. I’ve had quite a bit of experience with Lua, primarily from configuring **Neovim** (though I’ve since switched to **Helix** for my editor). Plus, Roblox also uses Lua, and I occasionally play it. More importantly, I have plans to develop a Roblox game one day, largely because of its potential for financial success.

### Considering a Handheld Gaming Device

As I continue exploring PICO-8, I’ve started thinking about taking my retro gaming on the go. I’m considering buying a **MiniYoo Mini Plus** and installing **Onion OS** on it to run PICO-8 games. The thought of having a handheld console where I can both play and potentially develop PICO-8 games is really exciting. It would be the perfect blend of nostalgia and modern convenience.

### Making My Own Games?

Of course, as I continue to immerse myself in the PICO-8 community, the thought of **making my own games** is growing stronger. The simple tools and Lua scripting make it accessible, and the retro aesthetic has a charm that’s hard to resist. Whether it’s a quirky platformer like Harold's Really Bad Day or something entirely different, I can’t wait to see what ideas I can bring to life.

That wraps up my early experience with PICO-8. It’s been an awesome journey so far, and I’m looking forward to diving deeper into the world of retro game development. Stay tuned for updates—who knows, you might see a PICO-8 game from me soon!
